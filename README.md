  This challenge included creating a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.  A bubble chart was also created to display various sample measurements when an individual’s ID is selected.  Finally, a gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency's value, with the display value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
